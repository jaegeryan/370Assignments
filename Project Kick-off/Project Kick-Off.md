### Overview

This semester, you will design and develop an information system backed by a MySQL database. In the spirit of *guided inquiry*, the grading of your project will be structured and transparent but you will have a lot of freedom to build whatever you think is cool!

In this kick-off assignment, you will set up your team of up to four students and your initial project direction, get some no-stakes familiarity with the grading rubric, and become connected with your TA-client. Don't worry too much: it's possible to change teams and directions later, but we need to get started! You will be providing video-based progress reports at a regular interval of two-week sprints all semester.

In each sprint (including this one!), you will provide evidence that you have achieved the goals that you set two weeks ago. For example, you may demo some interaction with your database using SQL, run through some theory or design specifications, or conduct performance experiments. It's completely flexible how you show that you're making progress, but we have a strong teaching team that can't be fooled easily! The progress needs to be genuine. You can, of course, talk to them and coordinate on what you're doing and to what extent it's meeting their expectations.

You will also plan out what you'll do in the next two week sprint. You have to show somehow how this development plan also aligns with the pretty clearly stated competencies in the course outline and covered in the previous two weeks of classes. While you can pretty much do anything, you do have to explicitly connect it to the course in a way that, ultimately, your TA-client finds convincing.

###  Your TA-Client

Each group will be assigned to a teaching assistant (TA). This TA will play three roles for your group: mentor, client, and evaluator. They can provide support and answer questions that you have but they can also make demands that increase the scope of your project if they feel your plan is not meeting their needs. I guess this is what clients often do.

The availability of your TA-client is constrained to one hour per semester per group member. If you have a group of three students (the expected/default group size), your TA-client will be available for thirty minutes per sprint. It is possible to work on your own for this project instead of in a group, but you won't receive as much support as a larger group would.

### Project Topics

You are free, even encouraged, to select your own topic. You should imagine some *system* that requires data. Yes, that's broad, but so to is the reach of databases and this course! If you want some suggestions, these topics are pre-approved:

- design [a social network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-Friendster.html) in which people can decide to follow each other and share information of some sort
- design [a movie rating system](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) in which people can rate things that they like or don't like
- design [a company inventory system](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/), such as a bicycle rental database, to track sales or rentals of products to customers
- design [a wiki](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/wikipedia) in which people can add descriptions about topics and link them to each other or view historical modifications to content
- design [a system for open government](https://search.open.canada.ca/opendata/) in which information about government activities such as grants are tracked
- design [a system for recording statistical data](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus) that can be accessed by the public but only modified by expert users
- design [a question and answer (Q&A) site](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) in which community users can contribute questions, answer questions, and up- or down-vote each other

 You are, however, encouraged to come up with your own project (with instructor approval). Some guiding questions that could help pick a topic are:

- could you redesign a database that you worked with on a co-op term?
- do you have some entrepreneurial idea that depends on data?
- have you interacted with data in some capacity that makes you think, "surely this could have been done better"?
- are you taking any other courses right now that could have interesting overlaps with this course?
- is there some tool that you use regularly that uses data and could be fun to reproduce?

### Submission & Evaluation

For each submission in this project, you should provide a git link with a commit hash and a video. The git link can be either on some public cloud service like Github (great for marketing yourself to prospective co-op employers!) or on our local gitlab.csc.uvic.ca server that has been set up for this course. You need to provide a hash that corresponds to the submission, however, and if the repo is private, you need to provide access to the instructor and your TA-client.

The submission will be graded per the attached rubric. Half the criteria are devoted to planning objectives and aligning them with course goals and the other half are devoted to how well you describe your progress towards delivering on this sprint's goals. We will use this same rubric throughout the course. This first attempt, though graded, is worth 0%, i.e., it is a zero-stakes, formative, learning opportunity.

Your video should be of length no more than two minutes + 1.5 × your group size. So, if you have a group of size 3, your video cannot be longer than 2 + 1.5 × 3 = 6.5 minutes. If it exceeds this, even by an attosecond, you will receive a failing grade on the submission.

Only one group member should upload the video, though it should be clearly noted (e.g., in the submission comments) who are the other group members. All members of the group will receive the same grade.

### Planning Scope

You should plan for the upcoming sprint to cover lessons and competencies **up to and including Basic Conceptual Design**.

### Initial Knowledge and Plan (for Delivery Scope)

As you develop your attempt at the 0% kick-off video status update, you should assume the following:

- Your course-level competency goal was to show that you can define application and business requirements, which is a new skill and advances your progress on the **Data Architecture** competency. To evaluate this, you will show a clear list of initial requirements and compare that to the (empty) list you had before the course began
- Your module-level competency goal was to develop a study plan for this course. To evaluate this, you will show how you have identified an interesting project that has the ability to cover many modules of the course. You have in mind a number of ways to increase complexity to meet more challenging learning objectives and you have in mind some way of obtaining or generating useful data.

This will allow you to report on the delivery criteria in your kick-off video and get a better feel for the expectations.

### Collaboration & Policies

Your are encouraged to work together as a team, to access resources online, and to engage the teaching team early and often. This project has the potential to be a strong portfolio item on your resume and Github profile. If you use ideas or code that were available online, you *must* cite those sources somewhere, ideally inline in your source files. If you use generative AI, you must also cite that and explain somewhere for which components of your project it was responsible and clarify how it has not undermined your development of course competencies.

### Conclusion

Good luck! I hope you have a lot of fun with this project!
