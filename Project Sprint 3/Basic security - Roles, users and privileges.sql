-- Our project assumes that the game company rental company is running offline and there is only one database control terminal (the boss's PC), the boss has the highest privileges and logs in through the user 'boss', while all other employees log in through the user 'employee'.

-- We don't need additional RESTRICT and CASCADE because all users get their privileges by inheriting the role, the user doesn't grant privileges to other users, so there's no need for restrict, and when the privileges of the role are modified, the privileges of all the users who are inheriting the role will be affected in the same way, so there's no need for CASCADE.
